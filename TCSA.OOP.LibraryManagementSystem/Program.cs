Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly. Instead, they serve as a blueprint for
other classes that will inherit from it.

An abstract call can contain both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete
methods (with implementation)

Inheritance in OOP allows one class to inherit the propertis and methods of another class,
facilitating code reusability and establishing a heirarchical relationship.
